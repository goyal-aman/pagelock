I have an idea of a website where user can come enter a url and a password and they get a new url. Any one who opens the new url gets a password field to enter. If password is correct user gets redirected to original link. This needs no server purely frontend capability. How? Lets talk javascript. The user enters the url, then lets encode it in base64 (or something better if you see a problem in it) and then lets encrypt the base64 item with the password user entered. the final encrypted key now has a url. when the final encrypted key is done then url will be redirected to http://www.<doman>/<encrypted_url> on this page they will have to enter password. If the password is correct the encrypted url will be decrypted and user will be redirected to original url.
